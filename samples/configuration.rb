# Pacto can be configured via a block:
Pacto.configure do |c|
  # Path for loading/storing contracts.
  c.contracts_path = 'contracts'
  # If the request matching should be strict (especially regarding HTTP Headers).
  c.strict_matchers = true
  # You can set the Ruby Logger used by Pacto.
  c.logger = Pacto::Logger::SimpleLogger.instance
  # (Deprecated) You can specify a callback for post-processing responses.  Note that only one hook
  # can be active, and specifying your own will disable ERB post-processing.
