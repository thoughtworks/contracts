# Now, if we run any code that makes an HTTP call (using an
# [HTTP library supported by WebMock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock#supported-http-libraries))
# then Pacto will generate a Contract based on the HTTP request/response.
#
# This code snippet will generate a Contract and save it to `contracts/samples/contracts/localhost/api/ping.json`.

# We're getting back real data from GitHub, so this should be the actual file encoding.
puts response.body

# The generated contract will contain expectations based on the request/response we observed,
# including a best-guess at an appropriate json-schema.  Our heuristics certainly aren't foolproof,
# so you might want to customize schema!

# Here's another sample that sends a post request.
